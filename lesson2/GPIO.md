# GPIO - General Purpose I/O

The GPIO functionality is the bread and butter of programming
microcontrollers. Microcontrollers have a number of pins (yes, the
little pins sticking out around the side of chip package) that can be
turned on or off and that can sense a voltage attached to them. Note
that a number of the LPC1343s pins are also support other
functionality...

To get started, switch into the `examples/blink` directory of the sdk
you checked out in the last lesson, open the file `main.c` and read
through the comment. Compile and run the code.

The `blink` example uses some extra code (located under `libs/everypio`)
that makes it trivial to turn pins on and off without having to write a
lot of boiler plate code. Once you've had a look at `blink`, have a look
at the example under `blink_pro`. This includes a bit of the necessary
boiler plate as well as using the systick interrupt to control the LED.

Continue reading here once you've worked through the examples and maybe
tried changing a thing or two ...

## Down and dirty boilerplate

To understand how IO really works on the processor, you'll need a copy
of the LPC1343
[usermanual](http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10375.pdf). Scan
through Chapter 9. If you've never read a datasheet or microcontroller
user manual before, this will see very intimidating and you probably
won't understand most of what you read, don't worry about it for now,
things will start making sense.


Configuring a microcontroller usually involves writing to a memory
location and manipulating values. These memory locations are accessed
just like normal RAM memory, but they are not connected to RAM, but
instead to physical peripherals of the chip (just pins for now...)

If you're not familiar with bit operation, binary numbers and
hexadecimal, please read the bits_bytes_and_nibbles.md chapter to brush
up...

The physical pins on the Everykey are organized into 4 "ports", each port
controls 12 pins. Each port is mapped into memory and contains a data
structure that looks like this:

    typedef struct {
    	HW_RW MASKED_DATA[0xfff];	//bit masked access to pins
    	HW_RW DATA;			//all 12 pins
    	HW_RS RESERVED1[0x1000];	//reserved (byte offsets 0x4000-0x7fff)
    	HW_RW DIR;			//direction bitmap. 0=in, 1=out
    	HW_RW IS;			//interrupt sense bitmap. 0=edge, 1=level
    	HW_RW IBE;			//interrupt both edges bitmap. 0=see IEV, 1=both edges trigger
    	HW_RW IEV;			//interrupt event bitmap. 0=falling edge, 1=rising edge
    	HW_RW IE;			//interrupt mask bitmap. 0=interrupt off, 1=on
    	HW_RO RIS;			//raw interrupt state bitmap, not masked by IE
    	HW_RO MIS;			//masked interrupt state bitmap, masked by IE
    	HW_WO IC;			//interrupt clear bitmap. Write 1 to clear edge interrupt mask
    	HW_RS RESERVED2[0x3f8];		//reserved (byte offsets 0x8020 - 0x8fff)
    	HW_UU UNUSED[0x1c00];		//padding to next GPIO bank (byte offsets 0x9000 to 0xffff)
    } GPIO_STRUCT;

This definition is taken from the file `everykey/memorymap.h` and mirrors the
specification in the user manual, see. Chapter 9.4. 

Every element in the struct above serves a specific function for
writing, reading and configuring the port. For example: GPIO.data
is a 32 bit value. The bottom 12 bits represent the state of the ports
12 pins. If a pin is configured for OUTPUT, writing a value to these
bits turns the pin on. If it's configured for INPUT the value of the
pin's bit will be either one or zero depending on whether there is
voltage applied to the pin.


## OUTPUT ... for now

The blink example only needs output, so we will concentrate on that for
now. The DIR member of the struct is responsible for configuring the pin
as output or input. If the bit corresponding to the pin we want to
use is set to 0 it's configured as output, if it's set to 1, the pin is
an input pin. 

Our processors  contains one of the GPIO_STRUCT (see above) memory
regions for each of it's 4 ports. These start at memory location
`0x50000000`, `everykey/memorymap.h` contains the following:

    #define GPIO ((GPIO_STRUCT*)(0x50000000))

which means: define an alias named GPIO which is a pointer (\*) to a
region of memory starting at 0x50000000. The contents of the region
corresponding to the type GPIO_STRUCT. The way C works, a pointer to a
region of memory can be used as an array, so if we want to access the
configuration for the second port, we can do so via:

     configuration_of_second_part = GPIO[1]

The first element of an array has the number 0, so the second element
has number 1 ...

In order to configure third pin of the second port to output, the third
bit of the DIR element of the second port configuration to 1:

    GPIO[1]->DIR = (GPIO[1]->DIR) | (1 << 3)

and in order to write a value (1) to the pin we need to set the
corresponding bit in the DATA element to 1:

    GPIO[1]->DATA = (GPIO[1]->DATA) | (1 << 3)

All this is basically handled for you when you use the functions defined
in `everykey/gpio.h` these functions are really just a wrapper to save you
some typing, but it's important to know what is going on under the hood.

## Why PORT and PIN? Terminology.

The whole port and pin thing can be a bit confusing at first... The term
"pin" is used to describe a number of different things:

* the physical pin stick out from the processor package
* the logical pin that you are reading from and writing to
* one half of the parameter pair "port/pin" that is used to identify the
  logical pin.

Pay attention to the context the term pin is being used in!

But why group pins into ports at all? The answer is that you can write
to a bunch of them all in one swoop. For example, if you want to set all
12 pins in a port to "1", you don't need to set each bit individually:


    GPIO[1]->DATA = (GPIO[1]->DATA) | (1 << 0)
    GPIO[1]->DATA = (GPIO[1]->DATA) | (1 << 1)
    ...
    GPIO[1]->DATA = (GPIO[1]->DATA) | (1 << 11)

you can just set `GPIO[1]->DATA` in one swoop:

    GPIO[1]->DATA = 0x00000FFF

Remember 0xFFF is 12 set bits in binary: 0b111111111111, one for each
pin.


## GPIO configuration

For some of the pins of the Everykey, it's also important to set the
function to PIO before using them, because by default they may be
configured to provide a different functionality. We won't get into the
bits and bytes, but the functions to do this are listed below:

    Function               | Description                    | Example
    every.gpio_set_dir     | set the direction of a pin     | every.gpio_set_dir(port, pin, OUTPUT)
    every.gpio_write       | write 0 or 1 to a pin          | every.gpio_write(port, pin, true)
    every.gpio_read        | read the value of an input pin | value = every.gpio_read(port, pin)
    EVERY_GPIO_SET_FUNCTION| configure function of a pin    | EVERY_GPIO_SET_FUNCTION(port, pin, PIO, IOCON_IO_ADMODE_DIGITAL);



## INPUT ...

Input works very similarly to output. Before you read this section,
please skim over the examples in `examples/lightbutton` and
`examples/lightbutton_pro` that illustrate how to use the Everykey's built
in button.

The basic functionality is more or less the same than for output:
configure the direction of the pin and then use `every.gpio_read` instead
of `every.gpio_write`. 

Input pins have more configuration options, though.


### Pull-up and down (and repeat)

The basics of Pull-up and Pull-down resistors are described in the
`examples/lightbutton` example in the SDK. In case you're not aware what
these resistors are for, please review that example.

In essence, pull-up and -down resistors are meant to ensure that you are
always able to read a clean, valid signal from a pin. For example: the
buttons on the Everykey are connected to ground. If a button is pushed,
you can read a logical '0'. But when the button is not pushed, the pin
isn't connected to anything, it's said to be "floating". To avoid this
situation, a large resistance is connected to the voltage supply,
pulling the pin "up". This mechanism could be built out of an additional
resistor on the board:


                Switch     Pull-up
   
    Ground _______/ --+-----NNN---- V+
                      |
                     -+-
                     PIN
 

but this is not necessary, because our microprocessor is able to switch
pull-ups and pull-downs interally. To configure them, use the macro
`EVERYPIO_SET_PULL` in `everykey/gpio.h`:

    
    EVERY_GPIO_SET_PULL(PORT, PIN, <PULL-CONFIG>); 

the PULL-CONFIG parameter can have the following values:

    Value       | Description
    PULL_UP     | pull up 
    PULL_DOWN   | pull down 
    REPEAT      | set up or down depending on last value

REPEAT mode means that the processor switches the pull-up and down
resistors depending on the current level at the pin. If the value is
high, a pull-up resistor is set, a low level enables a pull down. In
consequence the pin retains its last value even if that value is no
longer being driven externally.

### Hystersis

A number of the available IO pins support hysteresis (consult the user
manual to determine which ones.) The term "hysteresis" sounds a bit
intimidating, but the concept is simple. To determine whether the value
of the pin being read is a logical "1" or "0", the processor has
threshold values: if the voltage applied to a pin exceeds the HIGH input
threshold, a logical "1" is returned, the the voltage is less than the
LOW threshold, the value is "0". 

In real systems, though, the signals being transmitted between an
external device and the processor are not perfect, a transition between
LOW and HIGH may some time to level off and reach a stable state and
wobbles around a bit before it does.

Hysteresis is used to counter this effect. Once the HIGH threshold is
exceeded (a logical "1" is present) the HIGH threshold value is lowered
a bit. Conversely the voltage goes below the LOW threshold, the LOW
threshold value is raised a little bit. Now even if an unclean signal
wobbles back across the original threshold value, the logical value read
at the pin won't change immediately, this stabilizing the signal.


### Reading Analog Values

Some of the IO pins are also able to read analog values at the pin. This
means that instead of just being able to read logical "1"s and "0"s if
the voltage applied at the pin exceeds a certain threshold, they are
able to determine the voltage level applied to the pin. This
functionality will be examined in a later level.

### Interrupt configuration

As a final GPIO functionality, it's not necessary to actively read the
value of pins. You can just configure the processor to observe the state
of one or several pins and trigger a function whenever something
interesting happens. This functionality is described in the next lesson
about interrupts.
